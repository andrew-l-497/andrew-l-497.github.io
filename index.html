        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm currently a third-year at UC Berkeley studying EECS and Data Science who hopes to combine my experience with computer and data sciences with my passion for health and social good. I also aim to inspire conversations about diversity, intersectionality, and social responsibility in the workplace. Over the past summer, I worked as an Undergraduate Student Instructor for CS 61A, and have continued to work as a course tutor for this class, bringing my background as a student who took the course without computer science experience to help and support students in what is often their first computer science course.
          <br> When I'm not studying or working, I enjoy hanging out with friends, singing, reading fiction and poetry, and cooking tasty meals. In my opinion, the best way to start the day is with a good cup of tea.</p>
